⚔ - DSRV

⚔ - Dynmap

⚔ - TAB

# My PC hates MCAselector
My pc is dogshit and MCA selector (the plugin we're using to wipe old terrain) refuses to work with the current world. This probably has something to do with the singular world file being split into 3 which are combined using the datapack (which does not work on 1.18) so it's bugged for no reason
